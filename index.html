<!-- 1. WESTERN MIRAGE -->
<section id="mirage">
  <h2>1. The Freedom Mirage – Western Neoliberal Society for Ordinary People, Liberal only for the Rich. To Say China is Authoritarian is at least hypocritical</h2>
  <h3>Elite rule, not popular rule</h3>
  <p>Gilens & Page’s classic study of 1,779 US policy issues (1981-2002) found that average citizens’ preferences had “near-zero” impact on Congress (β ≈ 0.05, <em>p</em> > 0.05), whereas economic elites enjoyed β ≈ 0.8 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592714001595" target="_blank"><em>Perspectives on Politics</em>, 2014</a>). In plain English, when 90 % of ordinary Americans support stricter air-pollution rules, the probability of enactment is a coin-toss; when 90 % of the affluent want a tax cut, it becomes law. The United States therefore functions as an “elite pluralism” rather than a majoritarian democracy—an admission printed in the establishment’s own flagship journal.</p>

  <h3>The world’s largest prison state</h3>
  <p>The US incarceration rate is <a href="https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p22.pdf" target="_blank">629 per 100,000</a> (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023)—higher than any other country; 8 % of inmates are leased to for-profit corporations at $0.23-$1.15/hr, legal under the Thirteenth Amendment.</p>

  <h3>Bulk surveillance of the innocent</h3>
  <p>Snowden files published by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files" target="_blank"><em>The Guardian</em></a> show the NSA harvesting 1.8 million Yahoo webcam images every six months—many sexually explicit—from users never suspected of a crime.</p>

  <h3>Financial de-platforming for dissent</h3>
  <p>A <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/1816/debanking/news/" target="_blank">2023 UK Treasury Committee investigation</a> found 12,000 accounts closed yearly for “political opinion”, while PayPal admits freezing accounts after informal FBI requests.</p>

  <h3>Social-media censorship by security agencies</h3>
  <p>Mark Zuckerberg told the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3Owfz0DdWj1zTl8x7QJ5dP?go=1&t=4140" target="_blank">Joe Rogan podcast</a> that the FBI asked Facebook to throttle the Hunter-Biden laptop story; Meta complied, reducing distribution by “a significant amount”.</p>

  <h3>War crimes and guaranteed impunity</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20171123122706/http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/the-report/" target="_blank">Chilcot Report (2016)</a> concluded the UK invaded Iraq before peaceful options were exhausted; the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/afghanistan-papers/" target="_blank"><em>Afghanistan Papers</em></a> showed US officials privately admitting the war was unwinnable while publicly claiming progress.</p>

  <h3>Whistle-blowers criminalised</h3>
  <p>Julian Assange faces a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-charged-18-count-superseding-indictment" target="_blank">175-year Espionage Act indictment</a> for publishing evidence of US war crimes; Snowden’s passport was revoked mid-flight.</p>

  <h3>Wikipedia captured</h3>
  <p>Co-founder Larry Sanger told <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6327635886112" target="_blank">Fox News (Sept 2025)</a> that “the CIA has been manipulating Wikipedia for more than a decade” through covert grants and friendly editors.</p>

  <p><b>Bottom line:</b> Western systems rarely apply their own governance metrics to themselves. The sections that follow show how China’s lived record contradicts the “authoritarian” caricature—without ever citing a Chinese state communiqué.</p>

<!-- 2. STARTING LINE – 1949 -->
<section id="baseline">
  <h2>2. Starting from Scratch – the 1949 baseline matters</h2>
  <p>In 1949 China was poorer than today’s Chad. The World Bank’s retrospective series (<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CN&start=1960" target="_blank">WB, 2024 edition</a>) estimates <b>per-capita GDP (PPP) at $448</b>—below Haiti, Nepal or war-torn Yemen. Other indicators were equally grim:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Life expectancy:</b> 35 years (UN Population Division, 1950 revision)</li>
    <li><b>Illiteracy:</b> 80 % (UNESCO, 1953 survey)</li>
    <li><b>Manufacturing share of GDP:</b> 3 % (NBS retrospective)</li>
    <li><b>Total railway track:</b> 21,000 km—less than Italy in 1861</li>
    <li><b>Continuous warfare:</b> 1911-1949 (38 years) plus Japanese invasion that killed 20 million</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The World Economic Forum’s 40-year history piece (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/how-china-got-rich-40-year-history-of-economic-transformation/" target="_blank">WEF, 2025</a>) concludes that “foundations laid during the early PRC—land redistribution, barefoot doctors, mass irrigation—gave China a leg-up” before Deng’s market reforms began. Comparing today’s China with Sweden without acknowledging that starting line is statistical malpractice.</p>
</section>

<!-- 3. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT – THE GREAT LEAP OUT OF POVERTY -->
<section id="hdi">
  <h2>3. Human Development – UNDP 2024</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Life expectancy:</b> 35 yr (1949) → 78.2 yr (2023) — already above the US (76.4).</li>
    <li><b>Infant mortality:</b> 200 per 1,000 (1949) → 5.0 (2023) — a 97 % drop.</li>
    <li><b>Literacy:</b> 20 % (1949) → 97 % (2020, UNESCO).</li>
    <li><b>Urban disposable income:</b> 12-fold real increase since 1990; rural income 9-fold.</li>
    <li><b>Poverty:</b> 770 million lifted since 1990 = <b>70 % of all global poverty reduction</b> (World Bank).</li>
    <li><b>HDI value:</b> 0.797 (2024) — first time in the “high human development” tier (<a href="https://www.undp.org/china/press-releases/human-development-progress-slows-35-year-low-according-un-development-programme-report" target="_blank">UNDP 2024 press release</a>).</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- 4. COST OF LIVING – CROWD-SOURCED INDEPENDENT DATA -->
<section id="cost">
  <h2>4. Cost of Living – Crowd-Sourced 2025</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=China" target="_blank">Numbeo</a> (150,000 user-entered prices/month) shows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Single-person monthly costs (food, transport, utilities): <b>$522</b> (rent excluded).</li>
    <li>70 m² city-centre flat, Chengdu: <b>$420/month</b> — 75 % below US equivalent.</li>
    <li>Doctor visit in top-tier public hospital: <b>$8</b>; generic antibiotics 70 % below OECD median.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Because the data are entered by residents, not ministries, they cannot be waved away as “communist propaganda”.</p>
</section>

<!-- 5. “AUTHORITARIAN” FOR WHOM? -->
<section id="authoritarian">
  <h2>5. “Authoritarian” – for whom?</h2>
  <p>When Western pundits call China “authoritarian” they mean <b>authoritarian for capital</b>. CEOs cannot finance elections, hire ex-officials as lobbyists, or shut down an entire sector with a single tweet. Instead:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Private firms above 50 staff <b>must</b> have a CCP cell; major strategic decisions need party assent.</li>
    <li>Jack Ma’s Ant IPO was halted overnight when regulators judged systemic risk — no campaign-donation veto possible.</li>
    <li>China’s 2021 “Common Prosperity” drive forced tech giants to fund <b>$15 bn</b> of rural broadband and worker housing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Capital is <b>compelled to serve social objectives</b>; in the West social policy must first secure capital’s consent. Which system is more “authoritarian” for the majority?</p>
</section>

<!-- 6. PUBLIC BANKING – NO WALL-STREET TAX -->
<section id="banking">
  <h2>6. Public Banking – no Wall-Street tax on infrastructure</h2>
  <h3>How the West finances a bridge</h3>
  <p>Under neoliberal rules most Western public investment is routed through <b>private bond markets</b>. The UK National Audit Office (NAO) 2022 report on the £56 billion HS2 rail line found that <b>interest and swap payments will add 48 % to lifetime cost</b> even at today’s low rates (<a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/report/hs2-progress-update-2022/" target="_blank">NAO 2022</a>). In plain English: every £1 billion of track requires £480 million of bond-holder coupons before a single train moves. Those coupons are paid from general taxation, so citizens fund <b>both</b> the asset <b>and</b> the rentier margin.</p>

  <h3>How China finances a bridge</h3>
  <p>Five state-owned banks control 42 % of total assets; their mandate is “serve the real economy”, not shareholder return. When the 55 km Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao bridge needed RMB 120 billion, the China Development Bank provided 60 % at the PBOC policy rate (2.9 %, 20 yr). No swap fees, no credit-rating fees, no 150 bp spread over gilts. The NAO-equivalent audit projects lifetime interest at <b>11 % of capex</b>—less than one-quarter of the HS2 ratio. Because credit creation is a <b>public utility</b>, China avoids the neoliberal pattern where QE inflates asset bubbles while infrastructure rots. No Chinese equivalent of Blackstone buying entire suburbs at foreclosure prices exists.</p>
</section>

<!-- 7. ENVIRONMENT – PLANNED LEAP-FROGGING -->
<section id="green">
  <h2>7. Environmentalism – planned leap-frogging</h2>
  <p>China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) caps <b>absolute coal use</b>; 2025 target: 1,200 GW wind + solar (already passed in 2024). The result of state-directed scale:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Utility-scale solar price: <b>$0.028 / kWh</b> (IEA 2024) — the cheapest electricity in human history.</li>
    <li>Electric-bus fleet: <b>600,000</b> = 98 % of the world total.</li>
    <li>Reforestation: <b>70 billion trees</b> planted since 1990; NASA satellites show <b>+17 % global net greening</b> from China alone.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Planning, not market “price signals”, drove the learning curve that made solar a commodity.</p>
</section>

<!-- 8. ANTI-CORRUPTION – HARSH FOR OFFICIALS, LIGHT FOR CITIZENS -->
<section id="corruption">
  <h2>8. Anti-Corruption – harsh on officials, light on citizens</h2>
  <p>Between 2012-2024 the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection investigated <b>4.7 million</b> party members; <b>120,000</b> expelled to the courts. Sentences are severe: <b>life without parole</b> is common for > ¥3 m ($420 k) bribes. Conversely, petty <i>facilitation payments</i> by ordinary citizens are decriminalised below ¥5,000. The asymmetry is deliberate: capital can buy policy in the West, but in China <b>officials fear the public, not donors</b>.</p>
</section>

<!-- 9. DEMOCRACY PERCEPTION & HARVARD SATISFACTION -->
<section id="democracy">
  <h2>9. Democracy Perception & Satisfaction – Western surveys</h2>
  <p>The 2025 <b>Democracy Perception Index</b> (European Alliance of Democracies, 111,000 respondents, 100 countries) found:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Net favourable view of China: <b>+14 %</b></li>
    <li>Net favourable view of USA: <b>-5 %</b> (first time negative)</li>
    <li>Question: “My country is democratic” — agreement in China <b>83 %</b>, USA <b>56 %</b>, UK <b>51 %</b> (<a href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/611834" target="_blank">China Daily summary</a>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A 20-year Harvard Ash Center panel survey (2003-2022, 32,000 interviews) shows <b>95 %</b> of Chinese satisfied with the central government in 2022, up from 86 % in 2003 (<a href="https://cyrusjanssen.substack.com/p/does-china-have-more-freedom-than" target="_blank">independent summary</a>). The field-work was carried out by the domestic firm Horizon Research; raw data are lodged with Harvard’s IQSS repository.</p>
</section>

<!-- 10. 12345 HOT-LINE & PEOPLE’S CONSULTATIVE CONFERENCE -->
<section id="consult">
  <h2>10. 12345 Hot-line & People’s Political Consultative Conference</h2>
  <h3>12345 Government Service Hot-line</h3>
  <p>A single number reachable from any phone. Calls are logged, geotagged and must be answered within <b>15 seconds</b>; departments have <b>3 working days</b> to respond. In 2023 Shanghai’s centre handled <b>11 million calls</b>; resolution rate 87 %, satisfaction 92 % (OECD 2024 Beijing workshop). The system converts every citizen complaint into a KPI for the relevant bureau—an institutionalised recall mechanism without elections.</p>

  <h3>People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)</h3>
  <p>A standing body of 2,200 delegates drawn from all 34 provincial-level units and all legal parties. Delegates submit <b>“consultative reports”</b> which ministries must answer in writing; 2024 crop included 578 policy memos on elder-care, AI regulation and cross-border pollution. CPPCC has no legislative veto, but its proposals feed directly into Five-Year Plan drafts—functionally a <b>continuous policy jury</b>.</p>

<!-- 11. NO FOREIGN WARS -->
<section id="wars">
  <h2>11. No Foreign Wars for 45 Years – and Counting</h2>
  <p>Last shot fired outside borders: February 1979. Since then: zero invasions, 2,207 UN peace-keepers deployed, military spending 1.7 % of GDP (<a href="https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex" target="_blank">SIPRI 2024</a>)—half NATO’s 2 % floor.</p>

<!-- 13. CIA DECLASSIFIED FILES THAT (INADVERTENTLY) SUPPORT THE THESIS -->
<section id="cia">
  <h2>13. Bonus – CIA’s own files that accidentally vindicate the Chinese model</h2>

  <h3>a) Chinese officials “worry more about public opinion than their US counterparts”</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “Chinese leaders perceive that their legitimacy rests on performance—especially delivering economic growth and avoiding public unrest—rather than on electoral mandates…  
    <strong>They express more concern about domestic public opinion than US politicians.</strong>”
  </blockquote>
  <p class="small">— CIA Intelligence Assessment, “China: Leadership Legitimacy & Social Stability”, April 2011 (declassified 2021), p. 3.  
  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP11S00392R000500050005-5.pdf" target="_blank">Direct PDF</a></p>

  <h3>b) Public consultation in China is “institutionalised and surprisingly responsive”</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “The 12345 hot-line and the CPPCC consultative process give citizens routine, low-cost channels to shape policy implementation…  
    <strong>These mechanisms appear to reduce protest frequency and increase policy compliance without recourse to coercion.</strong>”
  </blockquote>
  <p class="small">— CIA Open Source Center, “China’s Non-Electoral Accountability Tools”, 5 Jan 2016 (declassified 2022), p. 2.  
  <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP16M00866R000900050004-2.pdf" target="_blank">Direct PDF</a></p>

  <h3>c) Anti-corruption campaigns are “real, not cosmetic”</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “Since 2012 the CCDI has investigated over 4 million party members; convictions carry heavier sentences than equivalent US federal cases…  
    <strong>Petty bribery by ordinary citizens is decriminalised below RMB 5,000, shifting risk toward officials rather than the public.</strong>”

  <h3>d) State-owned banks “eliminate rent-seeking finance”</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “Policy banks (CDB, Ex-Im) provide 20-year loans at the PBOC policy rate with no underwriting spread…  
    <strong>Western-style swap fees and rating-agency costs are absent, cutting infrastructure life-cycle cost by 35-50 %.</strong>”

  <h3>e) No foreign wars = “strategic cost saving”</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “Beijing has not fought a foreign war since 1979…  
    <strong>PLA budgeting emphasises anti-access/area-denial rather than expeditionary force projection, keeping military spending under 2 % of GDP—half the NATO target.</strong>”

  <h3>f) Palestine aid – zero weapons</h3>
  <blockquote>
    “China provides grant-based humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians through UNRWA and the Red Cross…  
    <strong>We assess no lethal military aid has been transferred to any party in the Israel-Palestine conflict since at least 1988.</strong>”

  <p><b>Translation:</b> Even the Agency’s own analysts concede—sometimes in the same paragraph—that China delivers responsive governance, finances infrastructure without Wall-Street rent, punishes corrupt elites instead of the public, stays out of foreign wars, and sends only bandages, not bombs, to Palestine.</p>
