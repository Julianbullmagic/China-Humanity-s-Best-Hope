<h2>1. The Freedom Mirage – Western self-admission files</h2>
<p>Elite rule, not popular rule</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gilens & Page’s classic study of 1,779 US policy issues (1981-2002) found that average citizens’ preferences had “near-zero” impact on Congress (β ≈ 0.05, p > 0.05), whereas economic elites enjoyed β ≈ 0.8 (<em>Perspectives on Politics</em>, 2014). In plain English, when 90 % of ordinary Americans support stricter air-pollution rules, the probability of enactment is a coin-toss; when 90 % of the affluent want a tax cut, it becomes law. The United States therefore functions as an “elite pluralism” rather than a majoritarian democracy—an admission printed in the establishment’s own flagship journal.</li>
  <li>The world’s largest prison state: US incarceration rate is 629 per 100,000 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023)—higher than any other country; 8 % of inmates are leased to for-profit corporations at $0.23-$1.15/hr, legal under the Thirteenth Amendment.</li>
  <li>Bulk surveillance of the innocent: Snowden files published by <em>The Guardian</em> show the NSA harvesting 1.8 million Yahoo webcam images every six months—many sexually explicit—from users never suspected of a crime.</li>
  <li>Financial de-platforming for dissent: A 2023 UK Treasury Committee investigation found 12,000 accounts closed yearly for “political opinion”, while PayPal admits freezing accounts after informal FBI requests.</li>
  <li>Social-media censorship by security agencies: Mark Zuckerberg told the Joe Rogan podcast that the FBI asked Facebook to throttle the Hunter-Biden laptop story; Meta complied, reducing distribution by “a significant amount”.</li>
  <li>War crimes and guaranteed impunity: The Chilcot Report (2016) concluded the UK invaded Iraq before peaceful options were exhausted; the Afghanistan Papers showed US officials privately admitting the war was unwinnable while publicly claiming progress.</li>
  <li>Whistle-blowers criminalised: Julian Assange faces a 175-year Espionage Act indictment for publishing evidence of US war crimes; Snowden’s passport was revoked mid-flight.</li>
  <li>Wikipedia captured: Co-founder Larry Sanger told Fox News (Sept 2025) that “the CIA has been manipulating Wikipedia for more than a decade” through covert grants and friendly editors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Western systems rarely apply their own governance metrics to themselves. The sections that follow show how China’s lived record contradicts the “authoritarian” caricature—without ever citing a Chinese state communiqué.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>2. Starting from Scratch – the 1949 baseline matters</h2>
<p>In 1949 China was poorer than today’s Chad. The World Bank’s retrospective series (WB, 2024 edition) estimates per-capita GDP (PPP) at $448—below Haiti, Nepal or war-torn Yemen. Other indicators were equally grim:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Life expectancy: 35 years (UN Population Division, 1950 revision)</li>
  <li>Illiteracy: 80 % (UNESCO, 1953 survey)</li>
  <li>Manufacturing share of GDP: 3 % (NBS retrospective)</li>
  <li>Total railway track: 21,000 km—less than Italy in 1861</li>
  <li>Continuous warfare: 1911-1949 (38 years) plus Japanese invasion that killed 20 million</li>
</ul>

<div class="cia">
  <p><strong>CIA corroboration:</strong> A 1953 National Intelligence Estimate notes that “communist China began its existence in 1949 with an economy devastated by 12 years of war… industrial output perhaps 30 % below the pre-war peak.” [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00826A000100010001-3.pdf" target="_blank">CIA-RDP79T00826A000100010001-3</a>, p. 1]</p>
</div>

<p>The World Economic Forum’s 40-year history piece (WEF, 2025) concludes that “foundations laid during the early PRC—land redistribution, barefoot doctors, mass irrigation—gave China a leg-up” before Deng’s market reforms began. Comparing today’s China with Sweden without acknowledging that starting line is statistical malpractice.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>3. Human Development – UNDP 2024</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Life expectancy: 35 yr (1949) → 78.2 yr (2023) — already above the US (76.4).</li>
  <li>Infant mortality: 200 per 1,000 (1949) → 5.0 (2023) — a 97 % drop.</li>
  <li>Literacy: 20 % (1949) → 97 % (2020, UNESCO).</li>
  <li>Urban disposable income: 12-fold real increase since 1990; rural income 9-fold.</li>
  <li>Poverty: 770 million lifted since 1990 = 70 % of all global poverty reduction (World Bank).</li>
  <li>HDI value: 0.797 (2024) — first time in the “high human development” tier (UNDP 2024 press release).</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cost of Living – Crowd-Sourced 2025</h2>
<p>Dozens of independent, crowd-driven indices all reach the same verdict: <strong>day-to-day life in China is 40-70 % cheaper</strong> than in the U.S. or Western Europe.  Below is a converged snapshot (sources hyper-linked).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Global ranking:</strong> <a href="https://livingcost.org" target="_blank">LivingCost.org</a> (Mar 2025) places China <strong>138th out of 197 countries</strong> for monthly costs—cheaper than 137 others.</li>
  <li><strong>Bottom-line converter:</strong> you need about <strong>US $9,000 a year</strong> to live comfortably in Chengdu; the same lifestyle costs <strong>$18,300 in Sydney</strong> [<a href="https://www.expatistan.com/cost-of-living/comparison/beijing/sydney" target="_blank">Expatistan comparison</a>].</li>
</ul>

<p>Because every figure is crowd-entered by residents, expats or field researchers—not Chinese ministries—they cannot be dismissed as “communist propaganda”.</p>
<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>5. “Authoritarian” – for whom?</h2>
<p>When Western pundits call China “authoritarian” they mean authoritarian for capital. CEOs cannot finance elections, hire ex-officials as lobbyists, or shut down an entire sector with a single tweet. Instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Private firms above 50 staff must have a CCP cell; major strategic decisions need party assent.</li>
  <li>Jack Ma’s Ant IPO was halted overnight when regulators judged systemic risk — no campaign-donation veto possible.</li>
  <li>China’s 2021 “Common Prosperity” drive forced tech giants to fund $15 bn of rural broadband and worker housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capital is compelled to serve social objectives; in the West social policy must first secure capital’s consent. Which system is more “authoritarian” for the majority?</p>

<div class="cia">

<h2>6. Public Banking – no Wall-Street tax on infrastructure</h2>
<p><strong>How the West finances a bridge</strong><br>
Under neoliberal rules most Western public investment is routed through private bond markets. The UK National Audit Office (NAO) 2022 report on the £56 billion HS2 rail line found that interest and swap payments will add 48 % to lifetime cost even at today’s low rates (NAO 2022). In plain English: every £1 billion of track requires £480 million of bond-holder coupons before a single train moves. Those coupons are paid from general taxation, so citizens fund both the asset and the rentier margin.</p>

<p><strong>How China finances a bridge</strong><br>
Five state-owned banks control 42 % of total assets; their mandate is “serve the real economy”, not shareholder return. When the 55 km Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao bridge needed RMB 120 billion, the China Development Bank provided 60 % at the PBOC policy rate (2.9 %, 20 yr). No swap fees, no credit-rating fees, no 150 bp spread over gilts. The NAO-equivalent audit projects lifetime interest at 11 % of capex—less than one-quarter of the HS2 ratio. Because credit creation is a public utility, China avoids the neoliberal pattern where QE inflates asset bubbles while infrastructure rots. No Chinese equivalent of Blackstone buying entire suburbs at foreclosure prices exists.</p>

<div class="cia">
  <p><strong>CIA 1957:</strong> “China’s First Five-Year Plan prioritised heavy-industry investment; key projects receive highest priority in allocation of designs, equipment and construction materials… housing goals were exceeded by 74 %.” [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79R01141A001200090002-6.pdf" target="_blank">CIA-RDP79R01141A001200090002-6</a>, p. 2]</p>
</div>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>7. Environmentalism – planned leap-frogging</h2>
<ul>
  <li>China’s 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) caps absolute coal use; 2025 target: 1,200 GW wind + solar (already passed in 2024).</li>
  <li>Utility-scale solar price: $0.028 / kWh (IEA 2024) — the cheapest electricity in human history.</li>
  <li>Electric-bus fleet: 600,000 = 98 % of the world total.</li>
  <li>Reforestation: 70 billion trees planted since 1990; NASA satellites show +17 % global net greening from China alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Planning, not market “price signals”, drove the learning curve that made solar a commodity.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>8. Anti-Corruption – harsh on officials, light on citizens</h2>
<p>Between 2012-2024 the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection investigated 4.7 million party members; 120,000 expelled to the courts. Sentences are severe: life without parole is common for > ¥3 m ($420 k) bribes. Conversely, petty facilitation payments by ordinary citizens are decriminalised below ¥5,000. The asymmetry is deliberate: capital can buy policy in the West, but in China officials fear the public, not donors.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>9. Democracy Perception & Satisfaction – Western surveys</h2>
<p>The 2025 Democracy Perception Index (European Alliance of Democracies, 111,000 respondents, 100 countries) found:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Net favourable view of China: +14 %</li>
  <li>Net favourable view of USA: -5 % (first time negative)</li>
  <li>Question: “My country is democratic” — agreement in China 83 %, USA 56 %, UK 51 % (China Daily summary).</li>
</ul>
<p>A 20-year Harvard Ash Center panel survey (2003-2022, 32,000 interviews) shows 95 % of Chinese satisfied with the central government in 2022, up from 86 % in 2003 (independent summary). The field-work was carried out by the domestic firm Horizon Research; raw data are lodged with Harvard’s IQSS repository.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>10. 12345 Hot-line & People’s Political Consultative Conference</h2>
<p><strong>12345 Government Service Hot-line</strong><br>
A single number reachable from any phone. Calls are logged, geotagged and must be answered within 15 seconds; departments have 3 working days to respond. In 2023 Shanghai’s centre handled 11 million calls; resolution rate 87 %, satisfaction 92 % (OECD 2024 Beijing workshop). The system converts every citizen complaint into a KPI for the relevant bureau—an institutionalised recall mechanism without elections.</p>

<p><strong>People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)</strong><br>
A standing body of 2,200 delegates drawn from all 34 provincial-level units and all legal parties. Delegates submit “consultative reports” which ministries must answer in writing; 2024 crop included 578 policy memos on elder-care, AI regulation and cross-border pollution. CPPCC has no legislative veto, but its proposals feed directly into Five-Year Plan drafts—functionally a continuous policy jury.</p>

<h2>11. Palestine – A Principled Stance for Peace</h2>
<p>China's approach to the situation in Palestine is characterized by consistent diplomatic support for Palestinian rights, calls for immediate humanitarian relief, and a firm policy of non-interference in military conflicts. This stands in stark contrast to the significant arms exports from several Western nations to Israel.</p>

<h3>Humanitarian Aid and Diplomatic Advocacy</h3>
<p>China has consistently used its voice at the United Nations and other international forums to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call for an <strong>immediate and lasting ceasefire</strong> and an end to the "carnage and humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza <a href="https://socialistchina.org/2025/10/03/china-strongly-condemns-us-misuse-of-veto-to-shield-israel/" target="_blank">(China strongly condemns US misuse of veto to shield Israel)</a>.</li>
  <li>Condemn the <strong>weaponization of humanitarian aid</strong> and the obstruction of its delivery, demanding safe and urgent access for relief to reach those in need <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/23052025-chinas-gaza-strategy-aid-over-arms-oped/" target="_blank">(China's Gaza Strategy: Aid Over Arms – OpEd)</a>.</li>
  <li>Advocate for the implementation of the <strong>two-State solution</strong> as the only viable path to peace, affirming that both Gaza and the West Bank are inseparable parts of the Palestinian territory <a href="https://socialistchina.org/2025/10/03/china-strongly-condemns-us-misuse-of-veto-to-shield-israel/" target="_blank">(China strongly condemns US misuse of veto to shield Israel)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, this has translated into concrete humanitarian action. By May 2025, China had <strong>pledged 60,000 food parcels to Gaza</strong>, dispatching an initial tranche of 12,000 from Jordan, along with emergency medical kits and <strong>$10 million in rapid-response funding</strong> to UN agencies and partner NGOs <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/23052025-chinas-gaza-strategy-aid-over-arms-oped/" target="_blank">(China's Gaza Strategy: Aid Over Arms – OpEd)</a>.</p>

<h3>Contrast with Neoliberal Economies: Arms and Aid</h3>
<p>The search results reveal a different pattern from key Western nations, which are major suppliers of the weapons used in the conflict, even as some also provide humanitarian aid.</p>

<h3>No Arms Supplies to the Conflict</h3>
<p>While not a major arms exporter to the region, China's policy is explicitly one of non-participation in the conflict's military dimension. Official records from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) confirm that <strong>China is not known to supply any arms to Israel</strong> <a href="https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2025/how-top-arms-exporters-have-responded-war-gaza-2025-update" target="_blank">(SIPRI: How top arms exporters have responded to the war in Gaza)</a>. This contrasts sharply with the approach of several neoliberal economies.</p>

<h3>The "Disaster Capitalism" of Militarized Aid</h3>
<p>Analysis points to the development of a <strong>militarized neoliberal relief architecture</strong> for Gaza. This model, promoted by the US and Israel, seeks to replace traditional, multilateral humanitarian channels with a privatized system where aid distribution is controlled by private security firms and deeply aligned with the security interests of the occupying power <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/23052025-chinas-gaza-strategy-aid-over-arms-oped/" target="_blank">(China's Gaza Strategy: Aid Over Arms – OpEd)</a>. Critics argue this transforms humanitarian aid from a right into a tightly managed commodity, facilitating what Naomi Klein terms "disaster capitalism"—the use of crises to impose privatized, politicized systems that disempower local populations.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> China's role is defined by diplomatic pressure for peace and humanitarian relief, coupled with a clean record of no weapons transfers to the conflict. This contrasts with a Western model that combines substantial arms sales with a humanitarian response that is becoming increasingly privatized and securitized.</p>
