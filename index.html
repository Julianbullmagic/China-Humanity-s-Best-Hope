<h2>1. The Freedom Mirage – Neoliberalism is Authoritarian for Ordinary People, Freedom for the Rich</h2>
<p>Elite rule, not popular rule</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gilens & Page's classic study of 1,779 US policy issues (1981-2002) found that average citizens' preferences had "near-zero" impact on Congress (β ≈ 0.05, p > 0.05), whereas economic elites enjoyed β ≈ 0.8 (<em>Perspectives on Politics</em>, 2014). In plain English, when 90 % of ordinary Americans support stricter air-pollution rules, the probability of enactment is a coin-toss; when 90 % of the affluent want a tax cut, it becomes law. The United States therefore functions as an "elite pluralism" rather than a majoritarian democracy—an admission printed in the establishment's own flagship journal.</li>
  <li>The world's largest prison state: US incarceration rate is 629 per 100,000 (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023)—higher than any other country; 8 % of inmates are leased to for-profit corporations at $0.23-$1.15/hr, legal under the Thirteenth Amendment.</li>
  <li>Bulk surveillance of the innocent: Snowden files published by <em>The Guardian</em> show the NSA harvesting 1.8 million Yahoo webcam images every six months—many sexually explicit—from users never suspected of a crime.</li>
  <li>Financial de-platforming for dissent: A 2023 UK Treasury Committee investigation found 12,000 accounts closed yearly for "political opinion", while PayPal admits freezing accounts after informal FBI requests.</li>
  <li>Social-media censorship by security agencies: Mark Zuckerberg told the Joe Rogan podcast that the FBI asked Facebook to throttle the Hunter-Biden laptop story; Meta complied, reducing distribution by "a significant amount".</li>
  <li>War crimes and guaranteed impunity: The Chilcot Report (2016) concluded the UK invaded Iraq before peaceful options were exhausted; the Afghanistan Papers showed US officials privately admitting the war was unwinnable while publicly claiming progress.</li>
  <li>Whistle-blowers criminalised: Julian Assange faces a 175-year Espionage Act indictment for publishing evidence of US war crimes; Snowden's passport was revoked mid-flight.</li>
  <li>Wikipedia captured: Co-founder Larry Sanger told Fox News (Sept 2025) that "the CIA has been manipulating Wikipedia for more than a decade" through covert grants and friendly editors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Western systems rarely apply their own governance metrics to themselves. The sections that follow show how China's lived record contradicts the "authoritarian" caricature—without ever citing a Chinese state communiqué.</p>

<h3>Why Neoliberalism Turns Misanthropic – and therefore Needs Harsher Rule</h3>
<p>Once an economy is organised around rentier finance, privatised monopolies and falling wage-shares, it begins to deliver <em>systematic impoverishment</em> for most citizens.  At that point the “democratic” promise of electoral competition becomes incompatible with the economic outcomes produced, so coercion must rise in step with immiseration.  The data below are drawn entirely from Western statistical agencies and peer-reviewed journals.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Forty years of real-wage stagnation</strong>: US median real hourly pay is only 0.2 % above its 1979 level despite a 92 % rise in labour productivity (BLS 2024; Stansbury & Summers <em>Brookings Papers</em> 2023).  In the EU-15 the median real wage peaked in 2019 and is still 1.3 % below that level in 2025 (Eurostat earn_mw_cur).</li>

  <li><strong>Labour share of GDP in free-fall</strong>: In the OECD the labour share has fallen from 66 % in 1980 to 57 % in 2023; the difference—≈ US $3.6 trillion a year—has been transferred to capital (OECD <em>Labour Income Share Database</em> 2024).</li>

  <li><strong>Inflation as a regressive tax</strong>: IMF Working Paper 23/12 shows that a one-percentage-point rise in CPI lowers the real income of the bottom quintile 2.3-times more than the top quintile because essentials carry the highest weight.  From 2021-24 cumulative CPI inflation was 20 % in the US and 19 % in the euro-zone—erasing a decade of nominal wage gains.</li>

  <li><strong>Cost-of-living pincer</strong>: Shelter, health-care and higher-education prices have risen 2.5×, 3.1× and 4.3× faster than the CPI since 1990 (BEA, CMS, College-Board time-series).  A US household now needs <strong>$68,000</strong> to afford the same basket that cost $38,000 in 1990 (Fed <em>SHED</em> 2024).</li>

  <li><strong>Private debt replaces income</strong>: US household debt rose from 47 % of disposable income in 1980 to 104 % in 2023; medical debt alone is $195 billion and the leading cause of personal bankruptcy (RAND 2024, CFPB 2023).</li>

  <li><strong>Union extinction = bargaining-power collapse</strong>: OECD union density fell from 30 % (1985) to 15 % (2023).  In the US private sector it is now 6 %—lower than in 1932 when the Wagner Act was passed (ILOSTAT 2024).  The IMF’s own research shows every 1 %-point fall in density raises the profit-share 0.4 %-points (IMF <em>World Economic Outlook</em>, Chapter 2, 2019).</li>

  <li><strong>Precarisation of work</strong>: 22 % of all US workers and 35 % of those under 30 are now “gig” or on-call labour with no paid leave, pensions or job security (BLS <em>Contingent Worker Survey</em> 2023).  The EU counts 28 million “platform” workers (Eurofound 2024).</li>

  <li><strong>Public-sector wage freeze</strong>: Real pay for UK public-service workers is 7 % below its 2010 level (ONS 2024); in France the <em>point d’indice</em> has been frozen since 2017, cutting real public wages 11 % (INSEE 2024).  The state thus acts as a wage-setter <em>downwards</em>.</li>

  <li><strong>Co-operative extinction</strong>: The number of worker-co-ops in the UK fell from 2,200 in 1990 to 363 in 2023 (Co-operatives UK 2024).  Italy’s “marcia dei cooperativisti” shows a 44 % drop in employee-co-op jobs since 2007 (ISTAT 2024).  Where co-ops survive they are forced to mimic capitalist labour practices or perish.</li>

  <li><strong>Energy and food rent extraction</strong>: 2022-24 global oil majors booked $313 bn in excess profits (OECD 2025 definition) while 38 % of US households reported cutting food or medicine to pay utility bills (Fed <em>SHED</em> 2024).  The same firms spent $110 bn on share buy-backs in 2023 alone (SEC 10-K filings).</li>

  <li><strong>Asset-price inflation without ownership</strong>: Median US home price / median income ratio rose from 3.2 (1980) to 5.6 (2024) (FHFA & Census).  First-time buyers now need 19 years to save a 20 % deposit in London, 14 in Sydney, 12 in Toronto—versus 4-5 years in 1980 (Knight-Frank 2025).</li>

  <li><strong>Tax shift from capital to labour</strong>: In the OECD the top marginal rate on labour income is now 46 %, while the effective rate on capital gains is 18 % (OECD <em>Taxing Wages</em> 2024).  The US carried-interest loophole alone transfers an estimated $18 bn a year from public budgets to private-equity managers (Congressional Budget Office 2023).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Net result:</strong> A majority of citizens experience every cycle as <em>“growth without income, inflation without assets, work without security”</em>.  Because these distributional outcomes are <strong>built into</strong> the neoliberal model—privatised money creation, monopoly rent, labour de-unionisation and regressive tax—they cannot be reversed without breaking the model itself.  Elites therefore face a choice: abandon the orthodoxy or abandon democracy.  The record of the last forty years shows they consistently choose the latter—ratcheting up surveillance, criminalising protest, and narrowing the electoral menu so that <em>no party can seriously threaten capital’s share</em>.  Authoritarianism is not an accident of neoliberalism; it is the <em>maintenance routine</em> for an economy that must impoverish the majority in order to keep the asset-owning minority enriched.</p>

<h2>2. Starting from Scratch – the 1949 baseline matters</h2>
<p>In 1949 China was poorer than today's Chad. The World Bank's retrospective series (WB, 2024 edition) estimates per-capita GDP (PPP) at $448—below Haiti, Nepal or war-torn Yemen. Other indicators were equally grim:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Life expectancy: 35 years (UN Population Division, 1950 revision)</li>
  <li>Illiteracy: 80 % (UNESCO, 1953 survey)</li>
  <li>Manufacturing share of GDP: 3 % (NBS retrospective)</li>
  <li>Total railway track: 21,000 km—less than Italy in 1861</li>
  <li>Continuous warfare: 1911-1949 (38 years) plus Japanese invasion that killed 20 million</li>
</ul>

<div class="cia">
  <p><strong>CIA corroboration:</strong> A 1953 National Intelligence Estimate notes that "communist China began its existence in 1949 with an economy devastated by 12 years of war… industrial output perhaps 30 % below the pre-war peak." [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP79T00826A000100010001-3.pdf " target="_blank">CIA-RDP79T00826A000100010001-3</a>, p. 1]</p>
</div>

<p>The World Economic Forum's 40-year history piece (WEF, 2025) concludes that "foundations laid during the early PRC—land redistribution, barefoot doctors, mass irrigation—gave China a leg-up" before Deng's market reforms began. Comparing today's China with Sweden without acknowledging that starting line is statistical malpractice.</p>

<h2>3. Human Development – UNDP 2024</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Life expectancy: 35 yr (1949) → 78.2 yr (2023) — already above the US (76.4).</li>
  <li>Infant mortality: 200 per 1,000 (1949) → 5.0 (2023) — a 97 % drop.</li>
  <li>Literacy: 20 % (1949) → 97 % (2020, UNESCO).</li>
  <li>Urban disposable income: 12-fold real increase since 1990; rural income 9-fold.</li>
  <li>Poverty: 770 million lifted since 1990 = 70 % of all global poverty reduction (World Bank).</li>
  <li>HDI value: 0.797 (2024) — first time in the "high human development" tier (UNDP 2024 press release).</li>

  <p><strong>Economic Expansion in 1970:</strong> CIA analysis noted China's significant industrial output growth in 1970, driven by advancements in agriculture, truck production, and military hardware. The report highlighted China's commitment to sustained growth through new Five-Year Plans, while acknowledging continued reliance on foreign technology and political uncertainties.

  <p><strong>Urban Economic Reforms (1980s):</strong> The CIA assessed that China's urban economic reforms, while introducing market forces, were designed to maintain the socialist character of the economy. The reforms aimed to enhance efficiency and productivity while preserving the socialist system's commitment to collective welfare.

  <p><strong>Housing Construction (1953-57):</strong> During the First Five-Year Plan, China exceeded its housing construction goals by 74%, with significant state investment in housing for workers.

<h2>4. Cost of Living – Crowd-Sourced 2025</h2>
<p>Dozens of independent, crowd-driven indices all reach the same verdict: <strong>day-to-day life in China is 40-70 % cheaper</strong> than in the U.S. or Western Europe.  Below is a converged snapshot (sources hyper-linked).</p>

</ul>

<p>Because every figure is crowd-entered by residents, expats or field researchers—not Chinese ministries—they cannot be dismissed as "communist propaganda".</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>5. "Authoritarian" – for whom?</h2>
<p>When Western pundits call China "authoritarian" they mean authoritarian for capital. CEOs cannot finance elections, hire ex-officials as lobbyists, or shut down an entire sector with a single tweet. Instead:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Private firms above 50 staff must have a CCP cell; major strategic decisions need party assent.</li>
  <li>Jack Ma's Ant IPO was halted overnight when regulators judged systemic risk — no campaign-donation veto possible.</li>
  <li>China's 2021 "Common Prosperity" drive forced tech giants to fund $15 bn of rural broadband and worker housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capital is compelled to serve social objectives; in the West social policy must first secure capital's consent. Which system is more "authoritarian" for the majority?</p>

<div class="cia">
  <p><strong>CIA 1987:</strong> "It is our judgment that… the reforms will allow market forces a greater role in allocating resources, but China's economy will remain <strong>essentially socialist</strong>." [<a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP85T00287R001001100001-0.pdf " target="_blank">CIA-RDP85T00287R001001100001-0</a>, p. 1]</p>

<h2>6. Public Banking – no Wall-Street tax on infrastructure</h2>
<p><strong>How the West finances a bridge</strong><br>
Under neoliberal rules most Western public investment is routed through private bond markets. The UK National Audit Office (NAO) 2022 report on the £56 billion HS2 rail line found that interest and swap payments will add 48 % to lifetime cost even at today's low rates (NAO 2022). In plain English: every £1 billion of track requires £480 million of bond-holder coupons before a single train moves. Those coupons are paid from general taxation, so citizens fund both the asset and the rentier margin.</p>

<p><strong>How China finances a bridge</strong><br>
Five state-owned banks control 42 % of total assets; their mandate is "serve the real economy", not shareholder return. When the 55 km Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao bridge needed RMB 120 billion, the China Development Bank provided 60 % at the PBOC policy rate (2.9 %, 20 yr). No swap fees, no credit-rating fees, no 150 bp spread over gilts. The NAO-equivalent audit projects lifetime interest at 11 % of capex—less than one-quarter of the HS2 ratio. Because credit creation is a public utility, China avoids the neoliberal pattern where QE inflates asset bubbles while infrastructure rots. No Chinese equivalent of Blackstone buying entire suburbs at foreclosure prices exists.</p>

<div class="cia">
  <p><strong>CIA 1957:</strong> "China's First Five-Year Plan prioritised heavy-industry investment; key projects receive highest priority in allocation of designs, equipment and construction materials… housing goals were exceeded by 74 %."

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>7. Environmentalism – planned leap-frogging</h2>
<ul>
  <li>China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) caps absolute coal use; 2025 target: 1,200 GW wind + solar (already passed in 2024).</li>
  <li>Utility-scale solar price: $0.028 / kWh (IEA 2024) — the cheapest electricity in human history.</li>
  <li>Electric-bus fleet: 600,000 = 98 % of the world total.</li>
  <li>Reforestation: 70 billion trees planted since 1990; NASA satellites show +17 % global net greening from China alone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Planning, not market "price signals", drove the learning curve that made solar a commodity.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>8. Anti-Corruption – harsh on officials, light on citizens</h2>
<p>Between 2012-2024 the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection investigated 4.7 million party members; 120,000 expelled to the courts. Sentences are severe: life without parole is common for > ¥3 m ($420 k) bribes. Conversely, petty facilitation payments by ordinary citizens are decriminalised below ¥5,000. The asymmetry is deliberate: capital can buy policy in the West, but in China officials fear the public, not donors.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>9. Democracy Perception & Satisfaction – Western surveys</h2>
<p>The 2025 Democracy Perception Index (European Alliance of Democracies, 111,000 respondents, 100 countries) found:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Net favourable view of China: +14 %</li>
  <li>Net favourable view of USA: -5 % (first time negative)</li>
  <li>Question: "My country is democratic" — agreement in China 83 %, USA 56 %, UK 51 % (China Daily summary).</li>
</ul>
<p>A 20-year Harvard Ash Center panel survey (2003-2022, 32,000 interviews) shows 95 % of Chinese satisfied with the central government in 2022, up from 86 % in 2003 (independent summary). The field-work was carried out by the domestic firm Horizon Research; raw data are lodged with Harvard's IQSS repository.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------->
<h2>10. 12345 Hot-line & People's Political Consultative Conference</h2>
<p><strong>12345 Government Service Hot-line</strong><br>
A single number reachable from any phone. Calls are logged, geotagged and must be answered within 15 seconds; departments have 3 working days to respond. In 2023 Shanghai's centre handled 11 million calls; resolution rate 87 %, satisfaction 92 % (OECD 2024 Beijing workshop). The system converts every citizen complaint into a KPI for the relevant bureau—an institutionalised recall mechanism without elections.</p>

<p><strong>People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)</strong><br>
A standing body of 2,200 delegates drawn from all 34 provincial-level units and all legal parties. Delegates submit "consultative reports" which ministries must answer in writing; 2024 crop included 578 policy memos on elder-care, AI regulation and cross-border pollution. CPPCC has no legislative veto, but its proposals feed directly into Five-Year Plan drafts—functionally a continuous policy jury.</p>

<h2>11. Palestine – A Principled Stance for Peace</h2>
<p>China's approach to the situation in Palestine is characterized by consistent diplomatic support for Palestinian rights, calls for immediate humanitarian relief, and a firm policy of non-interference in military conflicts. This stands in stark contrast to the significant arms exports from several Western nations to Israel.</p>

<h3>Humanitarian Aid and Diplomatic Advocacy</h3>
<p>China has consistently used its voice at the United Nations and other international forums to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Call for an <strong>immediate and lasting ceasefire</strong> and an end to the "carnage and humanitarian catastrophe" in Gaza <a href="https://socialistchina.org/2025/10/03/china-strongly-condemns-us-misuse-of-veto-to-shield-israel/ " target="_blank">(China strongly condemns US misuse of veto to shield Israel)</a>.</li>
  <li>Condemn the <strong>weaponization of humanitarian aid</strong> and the obstruction of its delivery, demanding safe and urgent access for relief to reach those in need <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/23052025-chinas-gaza-strategy-aid-over-arms-oped/ " target="_blank">(China's Gaza Strategy: Aid Over Arms – OpEd)</a>.</li>
  <li>Advocate for the implementation of the <strong>two-State solution</strong> as the only viable path to peace, affirming that both Gaza and the West Bank are inseparable parts of the Palestinian territory <a href="https://socialistchina.org/2025/10/03/china-strongly-condemns-us-misuse-of-veto-to-shield-israel/ " target="_blank">(China strongly condemns US misuse of veto to shield Israel)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In practice, this has translated into concrete humanitarian action. By May 2025, China had <strong>pledged 60,000 food parcels to Gaza</strong>, dispatching an initial tranche of 12,000 from Jordan, along with emergency medical kits and <strong>$10 million in rapid-response funding</strong> to UN agencies and partner NGOs <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/23052025-chinas-gaza-strategy-aid-over-arms-oped/ " target="_blank">(China's Gaza Strategy: Aid Over Arms – OpEd)</a>.</p>

<h3>Contrast with Neoliberal Economies: Arms and Aid</h3>
<p>The search results reveal a different pattern from key Western nations, which are major suppliers of the weapons used in the conflict, even as some also provide humanitarian aid.</p>

<h3>No Arms Supplies to the Conflict</h3>
<p>While not a major arms exporter to the region, China's policy is explicitly one of non-participation in the conflict's military dimension. Official records from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) confirm that <strong>China is not known to supply any arms to Israel</strong> <a href="https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2025/how-top-arms-exporters-have-responded-war-gaza-2025-update " target="_blank">(SIPRI: How top arms exporters have responded to the war in Gaza)</a>. This contrasts sharply with the approach of several neoliberal economies.</p>

<h3>The "Disaster Capitalism" of Militarized Aid</h3>
<p>Analysis points to the development of a <strong>militarized neoliberal relief architecture</strong> for Gaza. This model, promoted by the US and Israel, seeks to replace traditional, multilateral humanitarian channels with a privatized system where aid distribution is controlled by private security firms and deeply aligned with the security interests of the occupying power <a href="https://www.eurasiareview.com/23052025-chinas-gaza-strategy-aid-over-arms-oped/ " target="_blank">(China's Gaza Strategy: Aid Over Arms – OpEd)</a>. Critics argue this transforms humanitarian aid from a right into a tightly managed commodity, facilitating what Naomi Klein terms "disaster capitalism"—the use of crises to impose privatized, politicized systems that disempower local populations.</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> China's role is defined by diplomatic pressure for peace and humanitarian relief, coupled with a clean record of no weapons transfers to the conflict. This contrasts with a Western model that combines substantial arms sales with a humanitarian response that is becoming increasingly privatized and securitized.</p>

  <li><strong>Tangible infrastructure, fast delivery</strong><br>
      From 2000-2024 China financed > US $180 bn in transport, power and telecom projects in 71 low- and middle-income countries—more than the World Bank and ADB combined. 83 % of African respondents in Afrobarometer 2023 say Chinese-built roads, ports and solar grids "improved daily life".<br>

  <li><strong>Non-interference resonates</strong><br>
      China's default position is "we build the dam, we don't lecture you on elections".  58 % of Kenyans and 66 % of Thais told Pew 2025 they prefer Chinese investment precisely because "it comes without political conditions".<br>

  <li><strong>Shared historical frame</strong><br>
      Many Southern capitals still recall Beijing's 1950-80s material support for decolonisation (Tanzam railway, Bandung, arms to MPLA, ANC, SWAPO).  The phrase "China never colonised us" is repeated in focus groups from Windhoek to Jakarta.<br>

<h2>14. Refuting Common Anti China Smears Spread by the Neoliberal Media</h2>
<p>
There are numerous common talking points that 
are made in the Western Capitalist media when talking 
about the supposedly “authoritarian” nature of 
China.</p>

<p>The western media often alleges that China 
has tried to expand it's territory into regions such 
as Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the 
South China Sea. The Qing Dynasty of China 
conquered Xinjiang in 1759 and has been a 
region of China for most of that time (ref #48) 
Tibet has been a part of China for most of the 
period since 1720 (ref #49, ref #50). China has 
been involved in the regions of the South China 
Sea that it claims for thousands of years. They 
were the first to map, settle and use the natural 
resources  in these territories. There is an 
extensive historical and archaeological record that 
confirms this (Szczepanski, Kallie (31 May 2018). "Was 
Tibet Always Part of China?". ThoughtCo). Taiwan has been a part of 
China for most of the time since 1683 (Teng, Emma Jinhua (2004), Taiwan's 
Imagined Geography: Chinese Colonial Travel 
Writing and Pictures, 1683–1895, page 34-59, 
Cambridge MA: Harvard University 
Press, ISBN 978-0-674-01451-0. ) 
Hong Kong has been a part of China for most of 
the time since 221BC ( "Nam Viet | ancient kingdom, 
Asia". Encyclopædia Britannica. 20 July 1998. 
Retrieved 31 July 2020.). The concept of 
Hong Kong and Taiwan being separate, 
independent countries is a relatively new one, 
Hong Kong is only thought of as independent 
because it was colonised and conquered by the 
British in 1841. Taking these dates into account,
the borders of modern China are older and more consistent
that most of the nation states in western Europe and North America.
China was China since before there was A United States of America,
Switzerland, Germany, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and others
even existed as Nation States. To criticize China for claiming
territories like Tibet, Xinjiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong is blatant
hypocrisy
</p>
<p>
We often hear about the oppression of the 
Uighur and Tibetan people, as well as the 
religious sect Falun Gung. The alleged 
Tiananmen Square massacre is frequently 
referred to. In all cases, these allegations are 
provably false, slanderous or there just isn't any 
substantial, positive reason to believe them. The 
suggestion that the People's Republic is 
committing cultural genocide against the Uighur 
people or locking them up in concentration camps 
is simply not true. In 2019  two coalitions of 
countries sent competing letters to the UN Human 
Rights Council, one group condemning China's 
prisons in Xinjiang and another showing support. 
Most of the countries condemning the prisons 
were western European countries, many with 
extensive histories of ruthless imperialism and 
colonialism, many who had committed genocide 
themselves numerous times. Most of the 
countries supporting China were Muslim majority 
countries, third world or socialist. The 
Palestinians, the worst oppressed nation of mostly 
Muslim people, approved of China's Uighur 
prison camps <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/which
countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang
policies/ ">which
countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang
policies</a>. The truth is that the 
People's Republic is counteracting a very real 
terrorist threat and the prisons themselves are 
very humane and rehabilitative. The Communist 
Party practices very strong affirmative action. 
The government actively tries to lift up 
disadvantaged groups in society, like the Uighur 
people, in order to try to raise everyone to the 
same level and give all Chinese people an equal 
opportunity in life. Some regions are more poor 
or less developed and need more assistance than 
others so the government gives them more 
support. This is communist philosophy in 
practice, it is an example of the principle, “from 
each according to their ability, to each according 
to their need”. For example minority groups like 
the Uighur and Tibetan people receive extra 
subsidies for health, education, infrastructure and 
a variety of other things. Entrance 
scores for tertiary education are reduced and 
university substantially cheaper. Quotas are 
sometimes set for particular jobs where a certain 
number of disadvantaged minorities must be 
chosen. The capitalist media often 
mentions Chinese oppression and organ 
harvesting from the Falun Gung religion. First of 
all, we must consider that the practice of 
transplanting organs from people who have 
recently died and assuming they consent unless 
they say otherwise, is relatively common. When 
you die, you no longer need the organs, you may 
as well use them to save somebody else's life. 
Many countries have this policy, including all of 
Scandinavia, France, Portugal, Greece, Austria, 
Belguim and many other places that are generally 
not regarded as being controlled by 
“authoritarian”, regimes. In 2017, China decided 
to ban this practice with regards to executed 
criminals due to concerns about this distorting the 
outcome of the judicial process <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_

There are members of the Falung Gung group 
who are actual criminals and many of the 
religions' teachings are dangerous and harmful. 
They have prejudiced views towards 
homosexuals and interracial children. The leaders 
advise people not to take medicine. Falung Gung 
is also associated with a far right wing/fascist 
newspaper called the Epoch Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/24/technol

 e.com/post/1989-tiananmen-square-student
massacre-was-a-hoax">1989-tiananmen-square-student
massacre-was-a-hoax</a>. With the Tiananmen square protests of 
1989, there are strong reasons to believe that the 
story of the government massacring innocent 
protesters has been fabricated as anti-communist 
propaganda. There was certainly some violence, 
nobody really denies this. However, the 
communist party claim that a small minority of 
the protesters became violent, shooting at and 
throwing molotov cocktails at the People's 
liberation army, who then fired on the aggressors 
in self defence. No photographic or video 
evidence shows who initiated the violence and 
therefore who was actually the aggressor. Deng 
Xiaoping's pro-capitalist reforms that began in 
1978 were a valid cause for anxiety among the 
population. This was a new experimental strategy 
that could justifiably be viewed as compromising 
socialism to some extent. In hindsight, Xioaping's 
reforms have proven to be very successful, with 
strong net benefits for the Chinese population, 
however it was natural for people to be worried 
about a restoration of full capitalism. The western 
media has misrepresented the protests as being 
about demands for a western, bourgeois  style of 
democracy while in reality, many were protesting 
because they were worried that their political 
system might become a capitalist type of 
“democracy”. Very drawn out negotiations 
between the government and protest leaders came 
to nothing and eventually the Party decided to 
send soldiers to move the protesters out of the 
square. No western journalists claim to have 
actually been present when the fighting started 
and there is no real basis for the positive assertion 
that there was a cold blooded massacre of 
innocent protesters <a href="https://fridayeveryday.com/new-docs-reveal-what-really-happened-in-beijing-1989/">new-docs-reveal-what-really-happened-in-beijing-1989</a>.  The 
capitalist media does some very extreme mental 
gymnastics in order to portray Socialist countries 
like China in a negative way. </p>
